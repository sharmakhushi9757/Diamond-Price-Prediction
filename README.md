# Diamond-Price-Prediction #

### Statement of Purpose : ###

The purpose of this repository is to create a regression model that predicts the price of a diamond, and building a simple frontend application to make the model publicly available using Streamlit.

### Data Description : ###

The data we will be using for this project is the [Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds) dataset, which is publicly available via Kaggle. It contains 53940 observations, and 10 features in the dataset.

### Tools : ###

- **Pandas -** for accessing the data, and preparing the it for modeling.

- **XGBoost -** for creating a gradient-boosted regression model.

- **Streamlit -** for creating a frontend application
